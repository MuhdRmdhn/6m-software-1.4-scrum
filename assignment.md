## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
First of all, Scrum encourages cooperation and dialogue among IT team members. Daily scrums, also known as stand-up meetings, make sure that everyone in the team is on the same page, quickly resolve any obstacles, and promote an open atmosphere. Frequent engagement helps prevent bottlenecks, swiftly detect and resolve problems, and increase overall productivity.

Second, Scrum's iterative design promotes ongoing input and development. Each sprint concludes with an assessment of the team's work and input from stakeholders. This feedback loop lowers the possibility of significant rework later on by ensuring that the project complies with the needs of the school and enabling early modifications. As a result, the group may concentrate on producing components of the highest caliber that satisfy the client.

Thirdly, Scrum also stresses the need of having a prioritised product backlog, which is a list of tasks rated according to their value and relevance. By putting the most important jobs first, the IT team is better able to concentrate on developing crucial features and functionalities first. Prioritizing tasks first allows the team to gradually offer value, show progress, and maintain the satisfaction and engagement of stakeholders.

In conclusion, by focusing task management, increasing team accountability, improving cooperation, and providing constant feedback, incorporating Scrum into the school's IT infrastructure project can boost productivity. This agile methodology guarantees that the project moves forward without hiccups, can adjust to evolving needs, and produces worthwhile results quickly.

As a library member, I want to reserve a book online, so that I can ensure it will be available when I visit the library.

As a library member, I want to write and read reviews of books, so that I can share my opinions and discover new books based on other membersâ€™ reviews.
